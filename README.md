CMSI 488: Language Translation and Implementation (Compilers)
=======
Assignments from Language Translation and Implementation (Compilers) collaboratively completed with Zane Kansil ([@AuthorOfTheSurf](http://github.com/AuthorOfTheSurf)). We took this course during the spring semester in 2014.

In addition to this repository, most of the coursework was creating KobraScript, a programming language Zane and I designed. It can be viewed here: http://github.com/AuthorOfTheSurf/kobra-script.

### Learning Outcomes

These learning outcomes are taken from the syllabus. Students will:

* Gain a working knowledge of the fundamental concepts of programming language design, specification, implementation and translation through the very practical exercise of designing, writing, documenting, and testing compilers and interpreters;
* Gain a familiarity with compiler theory and design techniques and the notion of virtual machines;
* Increase their software development expertise by building a complex system (a compiler) using a modern toolset including node.js, npm, and mocha, as an open source project hosted on a public repository; and
* Take a new look at C and assembly language, making it less likely that their skills in these areas will rust completely before graduation.

### Assignments

There were five assignments throughout the course of the semester.

#### Assignment 1: Regular Expressions, Macrosyntax and Microsyntax, Abstract Syntax Trees

The first assignment involved solving regular expressions, some macrosyntax and microsyntax questions, and solving an abstract syntax tree. We also had to complete the first pass of the design of the language that we would be writing a compiler for during this term ([KobraScript](http://github.com/AuthorOfTheSurf/kobra-script)), giving our language description in the README.md of our public Github repository.

#### Assignment 2: [KobraScript](http://github.com/AuthorOfTheSurf/kobra-script) Scanner

Assignment 2 involved completing the scanner for the language and a scanner test suite utilizing Mocha. We also updated our README to reflect [KobraScript's](http://github.com/AuthorOfTheSurf/kobra-script) design changes through the challenges of working with a scanner.

#### Assignment 3: [KobraScript](http://github.com/AuthorOfTheSurf/kobra-script) Parser and Attribute Grammar Questions

Assignment 3 involved completing a parser for [KobraScript](http://github.com/AuthorOfTheSurf/kobra-script), with a professional unit testing suite that utilized Mocha. Our parser was required to be able to print an abstract syntax tree. In addition, assorted problems were assigned as well, including a CFG and attribute grammar questions.

#### Assignment 4: [KobraScript](http://github.com/AuthorOfTheSurf/kobra-script) Semantic Analyzer/Code Generator

Assignment 4 involved completing the semantic analyzer and code generator portions of our compiler with unit tests in Mocha. We were required to have good design notes on our wiki, and a history of issues that showed consistent progress throughout the course.

#### Assignment 5: [KobraScript](http://github.com/AuthorOfTheSurf/kobra-script) Optimization and Iki Feature Implementation

Our final assignment involved adding optimizations to [KobraScript](http://github.com/AuthorOfTheSurf/kobra-script). We also forked Dr. Toal's Iki Compiler and implemented new functionality.

### Completion of Class

Pending.
